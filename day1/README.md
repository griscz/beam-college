## Beam College Day 1 Assets

This directory contains the assets for day 1 of Beam College.

It currently has:
 * Slides for session 1 (Welcome, overview and business cases)
 * Slides for session 2 (Beam Model)
 * Slides for session 3 (Describe a Pipeline Declaratively - DAG) 
 * Python for the Demo.

If you open any of the notebooks from GitHub, you should be able to see at the top a link to launch the notebook in Google Colab. This will launch the notebook on a cloud environment so that you do not need to install anything. 

If you have trouble launching the Colab from GitHub, you can access a shared copy here:
