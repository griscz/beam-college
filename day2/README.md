If you open any of the notebooks from GitHub, you should be able to see at the top a link to launch the notebook in Google Colab. This will launch the notebook on a cloud environment so that you do not need to install anything.

If you have trouble launching the Colab from GitHub, you can also access a shared copy on Google Drive using the links listed above.
